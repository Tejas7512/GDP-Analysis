# GDP-Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to investigate the dataset “Countries of the World” and to focus on the elements that are influencing a Country’s GDP per capita. The dataset provides information about countries on population, region, area size, infant mortality, GDP, and more.

# Conclusion

Every element of our life uses technology, and the economics of the nation is no different. Greater decision-making, predictive analysis, and pattern identification are made possible by data science, which works with enormous volumes of data using cutting-edge tools and approaches. By analysing GDP using data science, we may learn about the variables influencing the GDP per capita of various nations. This aids in concentrating on the areas that promote economic progress.
